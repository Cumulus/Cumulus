For init the database, just execute initdb.sh with the user postgres.
And add the following line in /etc/postgresql/<maybe sub-dir>/pg_hba.conf:

local cumulus cumulus password

You'll also need to compile pgocaml with batteries support instead of the
original extlib. If you use opam, you can usr our custum repository containing
the patched pgocaml package:

opam remote -add mirai https://bitbucket.org/Engil/opam.git

Next you'll need to edit the package preference in ~/.opam/repo/index by
removing the word default after the pgocaml package name (to make « mirai » the
only repo used for this package)
