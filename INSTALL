How to get the dependencies
===========================

First you need opam (or you know what you are doing), and do:

 $ opam repository add ocsigendev https://github.com/ocsigen/opam-ocsigen.git
 $ opam repository add cumulus https://github.com/Cumulus/opam-cumulus.git
 $ opam update
 $ opam install cumulus-deps

You will still need to install with your packages manager
(aptitude, apt-get, pacman, …) the following packages:

 * postgresql
 * All the system packages needed by the opam packages (debian naming convension):
   * libpcre3-dev
   * libssl-dev
   * libdbm-ocaml-dev
   * And maybe I forgot some deps

How to setup the database and build
===================================

To init the database, just execute:

 $ sudo -u postgres psql -f createdb.sql

By default the password is 'cumulus', if you want to change that, then execute:

 $ sudo -u postgres psql
 postgres=# \password cumulus
 <type your password>

The final part is about to create a file named 'password' filled with the password you just gave,
and recompile the project with:

 $ make

Then either you can do:

 $ make install

and setuping your server or do:

 $ make run »

for testing.
