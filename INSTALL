For init the database, just execute (with the user postgres):

$ createuser -P cumulus
$ createdb -E UTF-8 -O cumulus cumulus

then add the following line in /etc/postgresql/<maybe sub-dir>/pg_hba.conf:

local cumulus cumulus password

and then execute (with the user postgres):

$ psql -U cumulus -d cumulus -f createdb.sql

The final part is to modify the password in src/db.ml to the password you gave,
and recompile the project with « make »

Then either you can do « make install » and setuping your server or do
« make run » for testing.
