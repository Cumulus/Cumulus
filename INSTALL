How to get the dependencies
===========================

First you need opam (or you know what you are doing), and do:

 $ opam repository add ocsigendev https://github.com/ocsigen/opam-ocsigen.git
 $ opam repository add cumulus https://github.com/Cumulus/opam-cumulus.git
 $ opam update
 $ opam install cumulus-deps

You will still need to install with your packages manager
(aptitude, apt-get, pacman, …) the following packages:

 * postgresql
 * All the system packages needed by the opam packages (debian naming convension):
   * libpcre3-dev
   * libssl-dev
   * libsqlite3-dev
   * libdbm-ocaml-dev
   * And maybe I forgot some deps

How to setup the database and build
===================================

For init the database, just execute (with the user postgres):

 $ createuser -P cumulus
 $ createdb -E UTF-8 -O cumulus cumulus

then add the following line in /etc/postgresql/<maybe sub-dir>/pg_hba.conf
(just after the line « # TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD »):

local cumulus cumulus password

and then execute (with the user postgres):

 $ psql -U cumulus -d cumulus -f createdb.sql

The final part is to create a file named password filled with the password you gave,
and recompile the project with « make »

Then either you can do « make install » and setuping your server or do
« make run » for testing.
